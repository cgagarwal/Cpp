# C++

1. C++ is a *general purpose*, *case-sensitive*, *free-form programming language* that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
2. C++ is a **middle-level language**, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

### C++ Standard Libraries

1. The core library includes the *data types*, *variables* and *literals*, *etc*.
2. The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
3. The Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.

### Object-Oriented Programming

1. **Inheritance**        --->    *capability of class to derive properties and characterstics from other class.*
2. **Polymorphism**       --->    *ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.*
3. **Encapsulation**      --->    *binding together the data and the function that manipulates them.*
4. **Abstraction**        --->    *displaying only essential information and hiding details.*


### Advantages of C++ over C

1. C++ is an **object-oriented programming language** and includes *classes*, *inheritance*, *polymorphism*, *data abstraction* and *encapsulation*.
2. C++ has a **rich function library**.
5. C++ allows **exception handling**, and **function overloading** which are not possible in C.
6. C++ is a *powerful*, *efficient* and *fast language*.
